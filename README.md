## Test task from Softaria
There are two hash tables.

The keys are URLs.
The values are the html code of the pages located at these urls.

Both tables reflect the status of all pages of a given
set of websites.

The first table shows the status of these sites as of yesterday.
The second one is for today.

The task is to write code that, using these tables, would compose
a letter in the following format:

Hello, dear Acting Secretary
